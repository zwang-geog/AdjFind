Description: A C++ program containing specialized path finding algorithms related to adjacency/proximity
 .
 The application supports three main modes:
 .
  * Road Segmentation Mode: Determines which service points (e.g., hydrants)
    are closest to each road segment using network distance, and optionally
    splits roads into discrete distance categories for service area analysis.
 .
  * Neighboring Points Mode: Identifies the nearest neighboring service points
    along a road network in each direction, calculating spacing distances
    between facilities like hydrants for regulatory compliance assessment.
 .
  * Structure Access Mode: Computes shortest unobstructed paths from building
    corners to road networks, finding the least accessible points on buildings
    for emergency response planning and fire code compliance.
 .
 This tool is particularly useful for urban planning, emergency services
 planning, and transportation network analysis.
