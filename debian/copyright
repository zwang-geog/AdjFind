 Note: Some GDAL files are licensed under BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause or other
 non-copyleft licenses. GDAL can be built against many dependencies, each with
 their own licensing terms (possibly LGPL, GPL or proprietary), hence the use
 of a GDAL binary can be subject to less permissive licensing terms than MIT.
 It is the responsibility of users to check that they comply with the overall
 licensing terms.
